NodeJS is a Runtime env for JS[not a Framework or Library]

           ARCHITECTURE OF NodeJS
Any request is made by two methods async or sync
Asynchronus[Non-Blocking oprations] -- just complete the operation and return

Asynchronous operations allow a program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for a long-running operation to complete in the background.
synchronus[Blocking operations] -- in this we asssign a worker to get job done and  then send they respond to the user once it is done

A synchronous function executes its tasks sequentially, completing one task before moving on to the next.
