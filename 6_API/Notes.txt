RESTfull API 
REST is a set of architectural constraints, not a protocol or a standard. API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.
When a client request is made via a RESTful API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON (Javascript Object Notation)

In order for an API to be considered RESTful API, it has to conform to these criteria:

A client-server architecture made up of clients, servers, and resources, with requests managed through HTTP.
Stateless client-server communication, meaning no client information is stored between get requests and each request is separate and unconnected.
Cacheable data that streamlines client-server interactions.
A uniform interface between components so that information is transferred in a standard form. This requires that:
resources requested are identifiable and separate from the representations sent to the client.
resources can be manipulated by the client via the representation they receive because the representation contains enough information to do so.
self-descriptive messages returned to the client have enough information to describe how the client should process it.
hypertext/hypermedia is available, meaning that after accessing a resource the client should be able to use hyperlinks to find all other currently available actions they can take.
A layered system that organizes each type of server (those responsible for security, load-balancing, etc.) involved the retrieval of requested information into hierarchies, invisible to the client.
Code-on-demand (optional): the ability to send executable code from the server to the client when requested, extending client functionality.
